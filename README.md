## Summary
Based on the outcom displayed within the visualizations and takeaways above Citi Bike is very popular within NYC especially for communiting within Manhatten especially with the male population.   In the more suburban locations use is not nearly as poplular.   The most popular days of use fall within the workweek and are comprised of trips mostly between 1 and 24 mins with the highest amount being at the 5 min mark which would help to explain the lack of use outside of downtown.
